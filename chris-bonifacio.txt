- [] Merge Conflicts in Git:

  - A merge conflict happens when changes are made to the same line of a file and/or if one person edits a file and another deletes it.
  - In order to resolve a merge conflict caused by competing line changes, you have to make a new commit in which you decide whether you want to keep only your branch's changes, the other conflicting branch's, or make a brand new change that combines changes from both branches.
  - Now you can merge the branches on the command line or push changes to your remote repository on Github and merge changes in a pull request.

- [] Git Commands:

  - git pull: The "pull" command is used to download and integrate remote changes. The target is always the currently checked out HEAD branch. By default, pull uses a merge operation but can be configured to use rebase instead.

  - git rebase: Rebase is one of two Git utilities that specializes in integrating changes from one branch onto another. It's different from Merge as it is always a forward moving change record, while Rebase has powerful history rewriting features.

  - git merge: The "merge" command is used to integrate changes from another branch. The target of this integration is always the currently checked out HEAD branch.

  - git reset: Resets current HEAD(points to the current branch or last commit made on branch) to a specified state. Can be a dangerous command if not used carefully as it is much more complicated than other git commands.

  - git revert: Revert some existing commits. It is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of earlier ones, usually only a faulty one. If you want to throw away all uncommited changes in working directory, there is the --hard option.

  - git clean: Remove untracked files from the working tree. Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control, starting from the current directory. Usually, only files unknown to Git are removed, but the -x option can be used to remove ignored files as well. This is useful for removing all build products.
